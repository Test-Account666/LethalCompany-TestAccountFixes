# TestAccountFixes

All my fixes in one mod.

There will also be more in the future :)

Current fixes:<br>
<details> 
  <summary>° Spider Web Fix</summary> 

Fixes some issues with spider webs.

For example, the issue where you're stuck in a non-existent cobweb.

</details>

<details> 
  <summary>° Dog Sound Fix</summary> 

Gives dogs some hearing aids.

Allows them to hear shotgun shots, toggling the safety and reloading.<

Optionally, will also fix the silent sprint bug.

If you're a psychopa- Umm, I mean... Nice person...<br>
You might want to check out the "Chat is loud" config option.<br>
That will make chat messages attract dogs.

</details>

<details> 
  <summary>° Automatic Inventory Fix</summary> 

Ever got your hotbar stuck and couldn't interact with anything?

Well, this mod tries to fix that.

There's an automatic fix and a button to activate it manually.<br>
The default button is `comma`.

(Activating the fix manually will cause you to enter the glitched state!)

</details>

<details> 
  <summary>° Item Grab Fix (Formerly 'ForceGrabItem')</summary> 

Breaks the laws of physics to allow you to grab items behind InteractTriggers.

No more easter eggs lost due to someone throwing them too close to the main entrance.

No more beehives lost due to a troll putting them inside the item charger.

There's also a button that allows you to bypass the fix while holding it.<br>
The default button is `leftShift`.

</details>

<details> 
  <summary>° Spider damage "Fix"</summary> 

Well, this isn't really a fix, but I thought it could fit inside this mod anyway...

Allows you to adjust the damage dealt by spiders.

It is deactivated by default to honor the vanilla damage.

</details>

<details> 
  <summary>° Player Speed Fix</summary> 

Fixes players being critically injured while not under 20 HP
